      <h1>About Magic Advent Calendar</h1>
      <p>
        Imagine you have someone special far away from you and you want to make a small surprise for them. 
        This digital advent calendar lets you create a personalized countdown experience filled with your 
        own messages, photos, and videos.

        I created this app to help people stay connected across distances, especially during the holiday season. 
        Sometimes the most meaningful gifts aren't things you can buy, but moments and memories you can share.

        <strong>Privacy First:</strong> This app doesn't store any of your data or content on our servers. 
        It simply provides a frontend tool to pack your own data in a specific way and allows you (or anyone 
        you share it with) to unpack and view the calendar you've created. Everything stays on your device 
        until you choose to share it.
