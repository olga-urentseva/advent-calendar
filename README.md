# 🎄 Magic Advent Calendar

Magic Advent Calendar is a web application I built from scratch as an experiment using **AI tools** such as Claude Code and Cursor.  
It allows users to create and share a **digital Advent calendar** by adding custom messages, photos, or videos for each day leading up to Christmas.  
The app then packages all the content into a single file that can be downloaded and later unpacked by anyone using the same app.
