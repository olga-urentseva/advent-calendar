# 🎄 Magic Advent Calendar

Magical Advent Calendar is a web application I built from scratch as an experiment.
It allows users to create and share a **digital Advent calendar** by adding custom messages, photos, or videos for each day leading up to Christmas.  
The app then packages all the content into a single file that can be downloaded and later unpacked by anyone using the same app.

Why experiment? - Because I wanted to create something only using **AI tools** such as Claude Code and Cursor. The goal was to see how different AI tools and models actually work in practice. I found that AI is great at speeding up the setup work and repetitive tasks, but it also creates challenges with reliability and long-term maintainability. For me, the takeaway is clear: AI can be a big help, but it still needs human judgment to make sure the end result is solid. 
So I had to change approaches a several times and refactor parts of the project, but the experimenting was worth it. **The big takeaway? We’re not doomed** — engineering still matters (yet), and AI just makes it more interesting.
