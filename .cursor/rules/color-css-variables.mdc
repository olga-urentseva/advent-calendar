- use css variables for colors only
- color variables must be abstract, without mentioned any color in a name of the variable
- use oklch colors only
- if a color can be gotten from another color, for example 'primary-color' and 'primary-light', it should be calculated, use `from` and manipulate OKLCH color
- keep high color contrast for accesability
